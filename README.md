# oscar-enhancement-suite
A suite of tools developed by Cortico Health Technologies to improve the Oscar experience of Cortico users. It includes some oft-requested quality of life improvements for Oscar, unrelated to Cortico. Clinics who do not use Cortico may still use this plug-in, but support will be a best-effort basis since we only have a support contract with clinics who run [Cortico]().

# General Oscar Quality of Life Features:
  * Drag and drop functionality on the schedule (see screenshot below)
  * A quick way to check public health insurance eligibility for your whole schedule.
  * Prevents Oscar refreshing while you are actively working (which interrupts your work). Oscar will wait until your mouse stops moving for a minute.
  * Includes very subtle user interface improvements (see picture below).

# Cortico Specific Features (optional)
  * Allows joining a video call directly from the schedule page.
  * Allows you to see diagnostic questions that patients answered in the online booking system.


We hope this repository can provide a helpful testing ground for some new Oscar UI feaures and we would love to contribute them to the Oscar source code for various OSPs who may be interested! Please contact me at clark@cortico.health if you want assistance merging anything here into Oscar itself.
